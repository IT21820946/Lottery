# Random Number Lottery Matcher
The "Random Number Lottery Matcher" is a Java program that simulates a lottery game. The program consists of a "Lottrey" class responsible for generating random lottery numbers and comparing them with user-input numbers, and a "Main" class that interacts with the user and orchestrates the game. Within the "Lottrey" class, a set of random lottery numbers is generated and stored. The "compareLottrey" method compares the user-input numbers with the generated lottery numbers to count the matching entries. The "Main" class allows users to input their chosen numbers and then displays the user's numbers, the count of matching entries, and the generated lottery numbers. This project can be a valuable addition to GitHub, showcasing your Java programming skills in simulating a simple lottery game and user interaction through console inputs and outputs.
